# Welcome!
Hi I'm Martin, nice to meet you!

I'm just here to help you set up things. When you have had enough of me or my help you can put something else [here](http://your.domain.com). No hard feelings! Glad to have helped. :)

Don't worry if you make some bad or hastily choices, if at any point you are not satisfied with the result you can go back in the process and change your choices, or start completely from scratch.

If you want to read more about me or contact me in any way you can visit http://martinhansen.io

So, let's get started!

## Who are you?

It would be awesome if you told be who you are so that I can contact you or offer you more help for instance. Maybe later add a link to my website too. But don't worry, this is not required.

If you are acting on behalf of an organization you can skip to the section below for organizations.

### Persons

#### Lets create stuff!

Now I want you to tell me what you want to create here. It could be anything really, a page about yourself, some pictures of your cat (this is the internet after all ;)), some blog post, etc. Just give me the names of those things.



TODO: later go public


### Organizations

#### Lets get serious

What is the first thing you want people that visit your server to see?

A public website?

What do you want to organize on this server?

Don't hesitate to list private things, we'll get to configuration of that later. Later you can structure things very orderly, just the way you want it, but lets just think a bit simple for now, so just give me a single list.

- Public information (like a website)
- Employees
- Sub organizations
- Customers
- Products
- Services
- Domain specific data
- Files (images/video)
- Communication

I have now created these resources at these locations:

/
/products
...etc

I also created /start, that is a resource that represents this initial process of setting up your server. This can be used for replication of your server should you desire to do so.
