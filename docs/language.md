The server should have in its memory a dictionary of the descriptions of the resources in its domain. It can be urls pointing to specific resources, or url templates that describes a class of resources.

I need to write a dictionary that exists outside entity representation. The dictionary consists of mapping between resource uris and the resource that describes it. The uris can be uri templates.
